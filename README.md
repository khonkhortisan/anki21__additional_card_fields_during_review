#### add-on for Anki 2.1 "additional card fields during review"

This is an updated version for 2.1 of [Additional Card Fields](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/441235634). The code was reorganized.

for even more fields you can add code from the file additional_code.py. This additional code likely contains errors. Put it in`__init__.py` below the line ` ###Add Mod here ###`.

Use it at your own risk.
